# Starting the calculator

To start view the calculator on a computer, it needs to be run on an Android Emulator
  -step one: open Android Studio
  -step two: choose "load project from github"
  -step three: run the project on the emulator in Android Studio

# Entering numbers and performing calculations

Please enter the expression that you wish to evaluate. Please use operators between numbers. Multiplication must be explicit and not implicit (for example, instead of entering: 4(5+1), please enter 4*(5+1).

When using transcendential functions, simply enter the values to be calculated by the function directly after the function, for example, to calculate sine of 10, enter "sin10" or "sin(5+5)" - note you do not need brackets if the function is evaluating only one value.

Once you have entered your function, press "=" to see the result.

# Clearing the screen or deleting values

The "C" button will clear the screen and set your value back to 0.

The "Del" value will delete the right-most operator or number from the expression.
