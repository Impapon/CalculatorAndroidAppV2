# CalculatorAndroidAppV2#
A basic scientific calculator app for android

It is written using java for the back end, and XML for the front end.

This app can evaluate one expression at a time. Please enter your first value, then the operation you would like, then the second value only if your operation require it, and then the equals button to get your result.

For example, if you would like to evaluate e^x with x being 5, press "5", then "e^x" and then "="

If you would like to evaluate x^y (for example x = 2, y = 3), then press "2", then "x^y", then "3" then "=" 

If you would like to do simple arithmetic, enter your first digit, then the operator, the second digit, then the equals button.

This app is a work in progress, the "sin" button still requires some work, and please ignore the "new button" for now.
