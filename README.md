#Starting the calculator#

To start view the calculator on a computer, it needs to be run on an Android Emulator. 
  -step one: open Android Studio
  -step two: choose "load project from github"
  -step three: run the project on the emulator in Android Studio

To start the calculator from an android phone, press the calculator icon on the Android app screen.

#Entering numbers#

When entering a number, pressing `+/-` will change the sign of the number. Pressing `.` place the decimal point in that number.

#Doing calculations#

To do a calculation, follow these steps:

For calculating a simple function (with addition, subtraction, multiplication, division and x^y):

1. Enter the first number.
2. Enter the desired operation.
3. Enter the second number.
4. The calculator will display the result in the bottom screen.

So for example, to get the result of `45 - 5`, presse the number `45`, then `-`, then `5`, which will print out the result in the bottom screen (i.e. `40`). Note that division by zero will result in an error.

For calculating a complex function (`sin`, `e^`, `10^`, `ln`, `log` and square root):

1. Enter the first number.
2. Enter the desired operation.
3. The calculator will display the result in the bottom screen.

So for example, to get the result of `10^5`, first press `5`, then press `10^,` which will print out the result in the bottom screen (i.e. `10000`). Note that `sin` takes it input in radians.
